# StringChallenge

This last lab question will require looping. Review the Week 3 lectures if you still feel uncomforable with looping.

You get a string from the user assigned to input_string. Your task is to create a program which after each run of consecutive equivalent letters will concatanate the number of consecutive characters in that run.

For example, if the input is:

aaaabbbcdddaa

Your code should print out the following:

aaaa4bbb3c1ddd3aa2

Each number corresponds to the number of times the preceding character was repeated consecutively.
